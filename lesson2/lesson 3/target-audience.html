        <h3>Target Audience</h3>
        <p>Our audience ranges from local residents to those visiting Portland Oregon and in need to search for local
            farms, businesses, trails, and parks that make Oregon the tree state. We cater to the young and the wise, no
            one is too young or too old to benefit from our website. We make it easy to find free events, explore
            nature, and discover the sweetness of local farms and homemade goods, not to mention access a list of the
            local business you can not find anywhere but Oregon.</p>
        <h4>Personas</h4>
        <p>1. A retired couple is looking to settle down in a place that does not get too hot in the summer or too cold
            in the winter. They want to be close to the mountains and the beach and love to go walking and hiking in
            their free time. They are looking to move to Portland Oregon, but are unsure which area has the best walking
            trails without sacrificing the convenience of locally grown produce.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>2. A family is visiting from out of town and wants to venture around Portland with their kids. They are tight
            on money and do not want to spend a lot while visiting. They have heard about the local farmers market and
            want to also check out parks and nature that are not far from where they are.
        </p>
        <h5>Scenarious</h5>
        <p>Where is the nearest park?
            <br>Where can I go to get locally-grown produce?
            <br>I want to pick my own strawberries for making jam, is there a farm nearby?
            <br>The kids are driving me nuts, what free event might be going on today that is near me?
            <br>In town visiting on a business trip, where would I find a really cool portland place to eat?
